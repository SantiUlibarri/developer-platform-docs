# Linux Documentation Samples

This section contains documentation written for **Linux users, operators, and developers**.

The focus is on:
- Task-based CLI documentation
- Operational workflows
- System-level concepts explained clearly
- Troubleshooting and error resolution

These documents are written with the assumption that the reader is technical, but not necessarily a Linux expert.

## Scope

The documentation in this section demonstrates:
- Clear explanation of Linux commands and services
- Practical examples over exhaustive reference
- Troubleshooting-first thinking
- Writing that supports self-service operations

The goal is not to document every possible option, but to help users **successfully complete real tasks**.
