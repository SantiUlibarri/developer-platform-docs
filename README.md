# Developer Platform Documentation Samples

This repository contains **developer- and operator-facing documentation samples** demonstrating how I approach documenting modern **developer platforms and infrastructure systems**.

The samples focus on:

- Linux and CLI-based operational workflows
- REST APIs and authentication concepts
- Cloud-native and Kubernetes-related systems
- Docs-as-code practices using Markdown and GitHub workflows

The goal of this repository is to complement my **enterprise product documentation experience** by showcasing writing intended for **engineers, SREs, and platform users**.

## What This Repository Demonstrates

- Translating low-level technical concepts into clear, actionable documentation
- Writing for developer, operator, and infrastructure-oriented audiences
- Structuring documentation for self-service and operational use
- Anticipating real-world failure modes, edge cases, and troubleshooting needs
- Maintaining clear separation between:
  - Conceptual documentation
  - Task-based guides
  - Reference material

## Repository Structure

- `linux/`  
  Documentation focused on Linux systems, CLI tools, and operational workflows commonly encountered in platform and infrastructure environments.

- `api/`  
  Developer-facing API documentation covering authentication concepts, error handling, and usage patterns, written to support integration and adoption.

- `kubernetes/`  
  Cloud-native and Kubernetes documentation designed to explain core concepts, deployment models, and operational behavior in a way that is accessible to platform users without assuming deep specialization.

Each section includes its own README describing scope, audience, and documentation intent.

## How to Read This Repository

If you are reviewing this repository as part of a hiring or evaluation process:

- Start with `linux/` to assess operational and CLI-focused documentation
- Continue with `api/` to evaluate developer-facing explanatory writing
- Review `kubernetes/` to assess cloud-native literacy and conceptual clarity

For examples of **enterprise-scale product documentation**, including release notes, security documentation, and integration workflows, see my primary portfolio repository.
