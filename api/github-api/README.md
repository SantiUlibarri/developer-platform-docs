# GitHub REST API — Repository Insights Documentation

This section documents a curated subset of the GitHub REST API,
presented as a realistic example of how I approach documenting
developer platforms and API-driven systems.

The documentation is written to reflect production-quality
developer documentation, with an emphasis on clarity, accuracy,
and testability.

---

## Scope

This documentation focuses on the following areas:

- Authentication using Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
- Repository discovery and inspection
- Issue management workflows
- Pagination, filtering, and rate limits
- Error handling and troubleshooting

It intentionally documents a **subset** of the GitHub API to
demonstrate depth of documentation rather than exhaustive coverage.

---

## Intended Audience

- Developers integrating with the GitHub REST API
- Platform engineers building automation around repositories
- Technical writers evaluating API documentation structure and quality

---

## How to Use This Documentation

1. Start with **Getting Started** to authenticate and make your first request
2. Review **Concepts** for authentication, pagination, and rate limits
3. Use the **API Reference** for endpoint-level details
4. Follow **Tutorials** for end-to-end workflows
