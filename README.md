# Developer Platform Documentation Samples

This repository contains **developer- and operator-facing documentation samples** created to demonstrate my ability to document:

- Linux and CLI-based workflows
- REST APIs and authentication concepts
- Cloud-native and Kubernetes-related concepts
- Docs-as-code practices using Markdown and GitHub workflows

The goal of this repository is to complement my **enterprise product documentation work** by showcasing writing for **engineers, SREs, and platform users**.

## What this repository demonstrates

- Translating low-level technical concepts into clear, actionable documentation
- Writing for developer and infrastructure audiences
- Structuring documentation for self-service usage
- Anticipating operational pain points and troubleshooting needs
- Maintaining clear separation between conceptual docs, task-based guides, and reference material

## Repository structure

- `linux/`  
  Documentation focused on Linux systems, CLI tools, and operational workflows.

- `api/`  
  Developer-facing API documentation, including authentication, error handling, and usage examples.

- `kubernetes/`  
  High-level cloud-native and Kubernetes documentation, written for clarity rather than depth of specialization.

Each section includes its own README explaining scope and audience.

## How to read this repository

If you're reviewing this as part of a hiring process:
- Start with `linux/` to see operational documentation
- Continue with `api/` for developer-facing writing
- Use `kubernetes/` to assess cloud-native literacy and explanatory skill
